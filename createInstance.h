TODO #2:
	Change this file by doing the following:
	1)=============== Changes at the top of this file: add a #include for Sequence1
	2)=============== Changes below in this file: add a #include for SequenceChecking1 in the appropriate place
	3)=============== Changes below in this file: add typedef lines that create an instance called IntegerSequence, 
	   create this instance from from Sequence1 and SequenceChecking1, add these in the appropriate places
	4)=============== Rebuild the project - it should rebuild without compiler errors, if you have compiler errors
	   then it is because something was incorrectly done in this file 
	5)============== After you successfuly rebuild the project, navigate to the bottom of driver.cpp file and find TODO #3
